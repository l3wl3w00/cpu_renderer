A simple interactive 3d "game", that is rendered in the terminal with either ascii or using the background color of each cell.

The color of each pixel is calculated individually using the most basic form of ray casting.

The game logic itself is very simple. The user can move the camera around in the world, which contains 10 randomly sized,
colored and positioned spheres and a light source that is moving in a circle

Controls:
- W, A, S, D, Q, E for moving the camera
- move the mouse to rotate the camera
- use tab to switch between ascii rendering and colored rendering with terminal cell backgrounds
